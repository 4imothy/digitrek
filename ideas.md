# game
- movement
  - can do a boost system with shift which moves you extra fast

# user interface
- custom colors
- publish to gitHub pages with the wasm
- custom font

# notes
- if we ever use `shift` possibly for the movement boost thing
  we will have to account for characters that change more than case
  on a shift, like `-` which becomes `_`
